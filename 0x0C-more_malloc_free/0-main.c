0x0C. C - More malloc, free
C
Memory allocation
 By: Julien Barbier
 Weight: 1
 Project will start Oct 6, 2023 5:00 AM, must end by Oct 9, 2023 5:00 AM
 Checker was released at Oct 6, 2023 11:00 PM
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free
Resources
Read or watch:

Do I cast the result of malloc?
man or help:

exit (3)
calloc
realloc
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
How to use the exit function
What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
Quiz questions
Great! You've completed the quiz successfully! Keep going! (Show quiz)
Tasks
0. Trust no one
mandatory
Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.

Prototype: void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);
Returns a pointer to the allocated memory
if malloc fails, the malloc_checked function should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98
julien@ubuntu:~/0x0b. more malloc, free$ cat 0-main.c

int main(void)
{
    char *c;
    int *i;
    float *f;
    double *d;

    c = malloc_checked(sizeof(char) * 1024);
    printf("%p\n", (void *)c);
    i = malloc_checked(sizeof(int) * 402);
    printf("%p\n", (void *)i);
    f = malloc_checked(sizeof(float) * 100000000);
    printf("%p\n", (void *)f);
    d = malloc_checked(INT_MAX);
    printf("%p\n", (void *)d);
    free(c);
    free(i);
    free(f);
    free(d);
    return (0);
}
